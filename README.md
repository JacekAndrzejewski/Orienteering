# Orienteering

This is an app solving Orienteering problem. It is a version of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP for short) with distance limit. This little piece of software uses genetic algorithm to find best cycle in the graph. It is not really effective, because for each dataset different algorithm arguments are best.

I created it for university project about year ago or so. In free time I will probably refactor it and try to get it better. Or maybe not, I have many more interesting projects.

To compile it simple "g++ -o Orienteering Orienteering.cpp" will work. Data should be in data.txt file, and found solutions are in the solutions.txt file.
